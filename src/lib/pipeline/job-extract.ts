function buildHiringPostPrompt(profile: any): string {
  return `You are parsing structured text blocks extracted from LinkedIn content search results. Each block represents a post where someone is announcing a job opening or sharing that their company is hiring.

Each block has:
- profileUrl: the poster's LinkedIn profile URL
- cardText: the raw visible text of their post card
- links: any links found in the card

CANDIDATE PROFILE:
${JSON.stringify(profile, null, 2)}

From each block, extract:
- **title**: The job title being hired for (infer from post content)
- **company**: The company hiring (from poster's headline or post text)
- **location**: Extract ANY city, state, country, or region mentioned anywhere in the post text or job description (e.g. "Bangalore, India", "Hyderabad", "Remote - India"). If multiple locations mentioned, list them. Use "Not specified" ONLY if truly no location appears anywhere in the text.
- **workMode**: ONLY set to "remote" if the text explicitly says "remote", "work from home", "WFH", or "fully remote". If a physical location is mentioned without explicit remote language, use "onsite". If both a location AND remote/hybrid are mentioned, use "hybrid". Use "unknown" if no work mode clues exist. Do NOT default to "remote".
- **salaryRange**: If mentioned, extract it (INR or USD). Otherwise null
- **jobUrl**: If the post links to a job listing URL (/jobs/view/...), use it. Otherwise ""
- **applyUrl**: If any link points to a direct application page (careers site, lever, greenhouse, workable, etc.), extract it. Otherwise ""
- **jobDescription**: Key requirements/responsibilities mentioned (summarize in 2-3 sentences)
- **recruiterName**: If the post mentions a hiring manager, recruiter, or says "DM me" / "reach out to [name]" / "contact [name]", extract that person's name. If the poster IS the recruiter/hiring manager, use their name. Otherwise ""
- **recruiterEmail**: If any email address is mentioned in the post text (e.g. "send resume to xyz@company.com"), extract it. Otherwise ""
- **recruiterUrl**: If a recruiter/hiring manager profile URL is mentioned (different from poster), extract it. Otherwise use posterUrl if the poster is the hiring contact.
- **posterName**: The person who posted
- **posterHeadline**: Their professional title
- **posterUrl**: Use the provided profileUrl
- **postContent**: The actual post text (not UI chrome)
- **postUrl**: If any link points to a feed/activity URL, use it. Otherwise ""

Then score each job against the candidate profile:
- **fitScore** (0.0-1.0): Overall match. Consider skill/domain overlap, seniority match, work mode, AND location eligibility.
- **stackMatch** (0.0-1.0): Fraction of the job's required skills/domain knowledge the candidate has
- **seniorityMatch**: "exact" (matches target roles), "close" (one level off), "mismatch"
- **urgency**: "high" (urgently hiring, immediate start, few applicants), "medium" (standard), "low" (vague or future)
- **reasoning**: One sentence explaining the score. Mention location eligibility.
- **draftMessage**: Personalized 3-4 sentence DM to the poster expressing interest. Reference their post, mention relevant experience briefly, professional tone.

LOCATION FILTER — CRITICAL:
The candidate is based in India. ONLY include jobs that are:
- Located in India (any Indian city)
- Remote with eligibility for India-based candidates (global remote, APAC remote, India remote)
- Remote with no specific country restriction mentioned
SKIP jobs that are:
- Onsite/hybrid in US, EU, UK, or other non-India locations
- Remote but explicitly restricted to US-only, EU-only, specific non-India timezone requirements
- If location is ambiguous, include it but note in reasoning

OTHER FILTERS — Also skip:
- Posts NOT about hiring (industry commentary, articles, etc.)
- Roles requiring skills/domain knowledge the candidate has zero experience with
- Roles clearly below seniority (junior, entry-level, intern, fresher)
- Recruiting agency posts without naming the actual company

Return ONLY a valid JSON array. No markdown, no code blocks.
If no relevant jobs found, return: []`;

- **salaryRange**: If shown, extract it. Otherwise null
- **jobUrl**: Use the provided jobUrl
- **applyUrl**: If any link points to an external careers/application page, extract it. Otherwise ""
- **jobDescription**: Whatever description snippet is visible
- **recruiterName**: If the card shows a recruiter or hiring manager name, extract it. Otherwise ""
- **recruiterEmail**: If any email is visible, extract it. Otherwise ""

- **seniorityMatch**: "exact", "close", or "mismatch"
- **urgency**: "high" (posted today/yesterday, "Actively recruiting"), "medium" (this week), "low" (older)
- **reasoning**: One sentence. Mention location eligibility.
- **draftMessage**: "" (no DM for job listings — user applies directly)

LOCATION FILTER — CRITICAL:
The candidate is based in India. ONLY include jobs that are:
- Located in India (any Indian city)
- Remote with eligibility for India-based candidates
- Remote with no specific country restriction mentioned
SKIP jobs onsite/hybrid outside India or restricted to non-India regions.
